This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes on Architecture

The app is built using GraphQL and the APolloClient library to load data into an initialState, which is then managed by Redux.

## Notes on the UI

I believe the app meets the functional requirements. The UI and UX is quite basic and there is much room for improvement in terms of user feedback - alerting the user to the maximum number of available options (toppings) for each Pizza etc. I can see many ways, with time, that the user experience could be enhanced.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
